I am an Assistant Professor in Digital Prototyping at Brock University's [Centre for Digital Humanities](https://brocku.ca/humanities/departments-and-centres/digital-humanities). I completed my doctorate at the University of Victoria, where I conducted [research on 3D geospatial expression](http://zaxis.uvic.ca/) and scholarly communication for the Modernist Versions Project (MVP) and Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) in the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL) and the Maker Lab. I also developed an open source [toolkit for digital humanities pedagogy](http://pedagogy-toolkit.org/) with grant funding from the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH). I am currently working on a book-length history of the mechanical production and interpretation of texts before the advent of digital computing.

# Book Project

## Modern Manuscripts. Procedural Expression. Digital History.
![lg left]({{ base }}assets/ProustMS.jpg)

My book project examines modernist experiments in the mechanical production of texts, examining manuscript materials of Proust, Roussel, Barnes, and Beckett. Across these and other authors, I am tracing experimental forms of composition that translate technological and political procedures into methods for arranging and revising literary texts. This project  offers a modernist history of the mechanical production and intepretation of texts, traditionally associated with digital computing. As part of this project, I am also prototyping online reading environments that move beyond digitizing the manuscript image to recover material forms of textual arrangement available in an archive.

# Z-axis research

## Geospatial Criticism. Cultural Critique. 3D Modeling.

**[Use the z-axis mapping tool](http://zaxis.uvic.ca)**

![lg right]({{ base }}assets/zaxis.png)

Z-Axis research is a mapping project that uses warped 3D maps to interpret modernist literature, rather than impose GIS-specific space on texts that predate digital mapping. This project's z-axis method uses data from modernist novels to warp archival maps from the modern period in 3D. The results visualize the spatial experience of the modern city as represented by a given novel, considering marginal and incomplete perspectives on the ground, rather than top-down or totalizing views from above. This project was first conceived by myself and Katie Tanigawa, and is currently under development with the Modernist Versions Project (MVP), Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE), and Compute Canada.

# Pedagogy Toolkit

## Digital Pedagogy. Open Source Repository. Social Knowledge Creation.

![lg right]({{ base }}assets/toolkit.png)

Pedagogy Toolkit is an open source and community-driven repository of teaching materials, community-authored guides to teaching with DH tools, and open access syllabuses and a syllabus templating tool. This project  applies an open source philosophy to course development, offering a platform for pedagogues to share, author, and develop digital activities and teaching platforms. The repository serves as a contact zone where tool developers and a range of humanities pedagogues can contribute their expertise. All content is free to use for any non-commercial purpose, including open source code for authoring teaching and project websites with no funds or technical expertise required. This project is powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages. I developed it with a [microgrant](http://ach.org/2014/07/09/ach_microgrants_winners_2014/) from the Association for the Computers and the Humanities (ACH).
